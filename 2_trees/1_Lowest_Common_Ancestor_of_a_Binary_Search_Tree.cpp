// Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

/*
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]

        _______6______
       /              \

   /      \        /      \
   0      _4       7       9
         /  \
         3   5
Example 1:

Input: root, p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6 
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
Example 2:

Input: root, p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself 
             according to the LCA definition.
