// The most common way to define graph is to use adjacency matrix
// example:
// (1) (2) (3) (4) (5)
// (1) 2 0 5 0 0
// (2) 4 2 0 0 1
// (3) 3 0 0 1 4
// (4) 6 9 0 0 0
// (5) 1 1 1 1 5
// it’s always a square matrix.
// suppose a graph has n nodes, if given exactly adjacency matrix
for (int i=1;i<=n;i++)
	for (int j=1;i<=n;j++)
		cin << a[i][j] << endl;

// Usually will go like this representation in data
// start_node end_node weight
// suppose m lines
for (int i=1;i<=m;i++)
{
	int x=0, y=0, t=0;
	cin >> x >> y >> t;
	a[x][y]=t;
	// if undirected graph
	a[y][x]=t;
}
// another variant: on the ith line, has data as
// end_node weight
// when you read data, you can assign matrix as
a[i][x]=t;
// if undirected graph
a[x][i]=t;
// Initialization of graph !!!IMPORTANT
// Depends on usage, normally initialize as 0 for all elements in matrix.
// so that 0 means no connection, non-0 means connection
// (for problem without weight, use weight as 1)
// If weights are important in this context (especially searching for path)
// Initialize graph as infinity for all elements in matrix.
// Another way to store graph is Adjacency list
// No space advantage if using array (unknown maximum number for in-degree).
// Big space advantage if using dynamic data structure (like list, vector).
// each row represent a node and its connectivity.
// we don’t need it so much due to it’s search efficiency.
// let’s define a node as
struct Node{
	int id; // node id
	int w; // weight
}; 
// suppose n nodes and m lines of inputs as
// start_node end_node weight
// assume using <vector> in this example
// g is a vector, and each element of g is also a vector of Node
for (int i=1;i<=m;i++)
{
	int x=0, y=0, t=0;
	cin >> x >> y >> t;
	Node temp; temp.id=y; temp.w=t;
	g[x].push_back(temp);
	// if undirected
	temp.id=x;
	g[y].push_back(temp);
}
// Note that you don’t need this node structure if graph has only connectivity information.
/**** Special Structure ****/
// Special structure here is usually not a typical graph, like city-blocks, triangles
// They are represented in 2-d array and shows weights on nodes instead of edges.
// Note that in this case travel through edge has no cost, but visit node has cost.
// Triangles: Read data like this
// 1
// 1 2
// 4 2 7
// 7 3 1 5
// 6 2 9 4 6
for (int i=1;i<=n;i++)
	for (int j=i;j<=n;j++)
		cin >> a[i][j];
// Simple city-blocks: it’s just like first form of adjacency matrix, but this time
// represents weights on nodes, may not be square matrix.
// 1 2 4 5 6
// 2 4 5 1 3
// 4 5 2 3 6
for (int i=1;i<=n;i++)
	for (int j=1;<=m;j++)
		cin >> a[i][j];
// More complex data structures: typical city-block structure may has some constraints on
// questions, but it has no boundaries. However, some questions requires to form a maze.
// In these cases, data structures can be very flexible, it totally depends on how the question
// presents the data. A usual way is to record it’s adjacent blocks information:
struct Block{
	bool l[4]; // if has 8 neighbors then use bool l[8];
	// label them as your favor, e.x.
	// 1 1 2 3
	// 4 x 2 8 x 4
	// 3 7 6 5
	// true if there is path, false if there is boundary
	// other informations (optional)
	int weight;
	int component_id;
	// etc.
};
// Note that usually we use array from index 1 instead of 0 because sometimes
// you need index 0 as your boundary, and start from index 1 will give you
// advantage on locating nodes or positions
