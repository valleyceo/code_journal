# LC 64. Minimum Path Sum

'''
Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.
Example 2:

Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
Output: 12

Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 200
0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100

    def minPathSum(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:

            for c in range(len(grid[0])):
                if r == 0 and c == 0:
                    continue
                elif r == 0:
                    grid[r][c] += grid[r][c-1]
                elif c == 0:
                    grid[r][c] += grid[r-1][c]
                else:
                    grid[r][c] += min(grid[r-1][c], grid[r][c-1])
        
        return grid[-1][-1]
