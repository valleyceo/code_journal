Note:
- M metals in the world
- lead is metal #1 on periodic table
- one formula:
	* create one gram of that metal by destroying one gram of two ingredient metals.
	* do not work with partial grams
	* can use as much as you like

Question:
- what is the largest total amount of lead you can end up with?

Input:
- T (test cases)
- M (number of known metals)
- following M lines:
	* Ri1 Ri2 (can create 1g current metal with 1g Ri1 and 1g Ri2)
- G1, G2, ... Gm (number of grams for each element)

Output:
- y (largest amount of lead, in grams)
